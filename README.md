# 1st Year College Assignment

## Solar System
* I created a UI of our Solar System.
* This UI contains each planet enlarged. Four are placed on the right and four on the left.
* Each planet on the lefts size is relative to eachother as well as each planet on the rights size is relative to eacother but the left is not relative to the right because the planets 
* At the center is not a representation of how fast the planets are but there as design.

## Instructions
* Float the mouse over each of the planets.
* Each planet has its information displayed at the top of the program.

## Description
* First I created a linked list and inputted data about each of the planets. 
* Each planet I then created using sphere(); which i decided to use to give the planet roatation effect.
* Using pushMatrix and popMatrix placed each planet accordingly and was able to create rings for Saturn and Uranus.
* I used mouseX and mouseY to detect when over one of the planets. This meant that i could enlarge the selected planet for effect.
* Using global ariable allowed me to easily enlarge the planets rings along with its planet.
* I had initally planned to put the amount of moons each planet had orbiting it but Jupiter and Saturn both have a large amount of them at 67 and 62, so I only put one moon orbiting Earth. 
* I used a for loop for the orbitting planets in the middle and made them go in random speeds in different directions for effect.
* I added abackground of stars and made everything quite colorful to avoid it being dull.
* For my grid i simply used line() and elliplse() to create add a bit of graphics to the program.

* My two classes were Planet and Sun. Planets got the information from the list and held the information for the size, speed etc. of the orbitting planets. The Sun was simply for the sun in the center of the program.
